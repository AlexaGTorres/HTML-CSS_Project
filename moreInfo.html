  <h2>Appreciation!</h2>
  <p1>It is Hispanic Heritage Month! As a way to celebrate we have decided to give you</p1>
  <br><br>
  <p2>information about a Hispanic cat! This kitty may have gone extinct and not recognized as a</p2>
  <br><br>
  <p2>standardized breed but we would still like to share its story.</p2>
  <br><br>
  <p1>These kitties were known as the "Mexican Hairless Cat" or as the "Aztec" cat. They typically did not have any fur, that is why they received their name, but during the winter they grew light fur along the back and tail.</p1>
