  <h2>Appreciation!</h2>
  <pre>It is Hispanic Heritage Month! As a way to celebrate we have decided to give you</pre>
  <pre>information about a Hispanic cat! This kitty may have gone extinct and not recognized as a</pre>
  <pre>standardized breed but we would still like to share its story. These kitties were known as the</pre>
  <pre>"Mexican Hairless Cat" or as the "Aztec" cat. They typically did not have any fur, that is why </pre>
  <pre>they received their name, but during the winter they grew light fur along the back and tail.</pre>
  <pre>The last owner of these kitties described them as intelligent, friendly and people</pre>
  <pre>-oriented. They enjoyed warm baths and liked to sleep in warm places. There isn't a lot of</pre>
  <pre>information on these precious kitties, but we would like to get you to know they existed.</pre>
